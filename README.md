**Players-Cloud** is a nodeJS backend to access and parse youtube video metadata. This works in conjunction with the iOS front-end called Players-iOS (specifically 2.x).

## Purpose

#### Introduction

I love watching videos in my spare time. Whether its watching TV shows on my TiVo or online via Youtube/Twitch. When I first got my iPod Touch in 2009, I religiously used the built in Youtube app to watch Gaming Let's Plays and other content. When Apple removed the Youtube app in iOS 6, I tried to find alternatives, however, as time went on these apps got bloated and I eventually got frustrated. I spent more time closing the built in popup ads and "Rate me!" dialogues than actually enjoying the purpose of the app, watching my favorite youtube channels.

I was just so fed up with other apps that I took it to myself to make something to satisfy my hunger of watching great content on Youtube.

#### Development Requirements

I made a list of things I wanted in this REST API:

- [nodeJS 9+](https://nodejs.org/en/): A simple lightweight server environment to quickly get up and running

- [express](https://expressjs.com): To build some webpages and the REST API part of the service

- [async](https://caolan.github.io/async/): Performance win for .each(...) & .parallel(...)

- [timsort](https://github.com/mziccard/node-timsort): Performance win using a battle-tested fast sorting algorithm

- [node-ytdl-core](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core): An abstraction over Youtube to access metadata for YouTube information

#### Roadmap

I initially I wrote this in 2014 and I've been slowly working on it to improve its performance and reliability on both the front/back-end side. With the front-end, I had to update the source to conform to the changes to the Swift language. With the back-end, I had to try different package and javascript techniques to shave milliseconds off the processing/response time.

I then updated the REST API to use default REST API conventions and be able to support JSON responses.

## Setup

##### Option 1: Local Server

1. Download the source: `git clone https://github.com/nextseto/Players-Cloud`

2. Get the packages needed to run the app: `npm install`

3. Go into the folder: `cd Players-Cloud`

4. Run the app: `YOUTUBE_API_KEY=<Insert Youtube API Key Here> node CORE.js`

##### Option 2: Heroku

## REST API

##### All APIs return JSON Strings with specific objects per API

`/channel/:ID` - Get the most recent videos for a given array of channel IDs (separated by commas)

`/video/detail/:ID/:format` - Get some details for a given youtube video ID

`/video/:ID/:format` - Get all the details for a given youtube video ID

`/search/:query/:nextToken/:options` - Get a list of videos for a given query, page token, and filter option 

`/channel/detail/:ID` - Get channel metadata for a given channel ID

`Everything else` - Redirects to this GitHub page

**To learn more about the API**...

- Look into the playgrounds file in the repository to have a more interactive way of experimenting with the REST APIs. 

- Look at the __examples__ folder for sample json responses.

- Alternately, CORE.js contains JSDoc documentation for the response and return requests payloads for each endpoint.
