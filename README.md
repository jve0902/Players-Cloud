**ytn-cloud** is a nodeJS backend to access and parse youtube video metadata. This works well with the iOS front-end called Players (ytn-iOS repository)

## Purpose

In short, this is a project that I started after my finals in 2015 with the goal to build my vision of a youtube app and to satisfy my hunger for viewing great youtube content. [Read the full story here](https://nextseto.github.io/project/ytn.html)
